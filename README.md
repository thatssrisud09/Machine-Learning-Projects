A Hybrid Medical Image Encryption Algorithm using Neural Network and Chaotic Maps

WORKED BY SRISUUDHARSAN AND LINKKESH


Even with todayâ€™s advanced telemedicine 
technology, there are still areas where security is compromised
for various reasons. This work proposes a novel encryption
algorithm for medical images that use chaotic maps and neural
networks for key generation. The permutation-based encoding
is applied to the input image followed by the diffusion by
XOR process with a secret image. The encoding and diffusion
processes ensure the change in pixel values which finally realize
the encryption process. The simulation results show that the
proposed algorithm effectively resists various differential and
statistical tests and is compared to existing algorithms for
performance analysis. As a result, for the proposed method,
correlation, information entropy, NPCR and UACI of the
encrypted and decrypted images have been measured and
tabulated for performance analysis. The analysis shows that it
works properly and efficiently.
